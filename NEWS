Changes in version 1.2.4:

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    
    o Add parallel argument in readBins().
    
    o Add parallel argument in mosaicsRunAll().

BUG FIXES

    o DESCRIPTION: 'multicore' package in 'Enhances' instead of 'Suggests'.

Changes in version 1.2.3:

NEW FEATURES

    o New model for deeply sequenced ChIP-seq data.
    
    o Genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data is now available.
    
    o Supports more aligned read file formats: eland_result, eland_extended, eland_export, bowtie, SAM, BED, CSEM.
    
    o Preprocessing of aligned read files can be done within the R environment using constructBins().
    
    o Easier model fitting for the two sample analysis using mosaicsRunAll().
    
    o Preprocessing and model fitting become much faster (Rcpp).
    
    o Parallel processing/computing is now supported (multicore).

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    
    o Add constructBins(): Preprocess aligned read files to bin-level files.
    
    o Add mosaicsRunAll(): Convenient two sample analysis.
    
    o Add bgEst argument in mosaicsFit(): Choose background estimation approach.
    
    o Add nCore argument in readBins(): Parallel processing.
    
    o Vignettes is now extensively updated.
    
    o Rcpp package is required and multicore package is suggested.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

    o Drop chrID argument in export().

BUG FIXES

    o Fix mosaicsPeak() for the case that no peak is called.
    
    o Fix export() by removing unnecessary spaces in output text files.
